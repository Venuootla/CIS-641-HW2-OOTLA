            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>HomeGoods Inventory Management is an online application that helps store managers manage their inventories more efficiently. 
               It includes secure user authentication, which allows only authorized managers to log in and create accounts.
            </p>
            <p>The application divides products into categories such as furniture, electronics, appliances, and home decor. 
               Each category provides a thorough view of individual items, allowing managers to simply add, remove, or change inventory details such as item descriptions, prices, and photos.
            </p>
            <p>We're thinking of using Firebase or MongoDB on the backend to enable smooth data processing and real-time updates. 
               The frontend will be built using ReactJS to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface. 
               Overall, this initiative seeks to improve inventory control and operational efficiency for shop managers.
